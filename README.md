# Cache estimator data.
This project contains the raw data output by champsim. 

The reuse distances and cache miss ratios we'll use for training are retrieved from the raw data via the clear_data.ipynb file.

This project acts as a database to the main project: https://github.com/MarkRamosS/ce_data/edit/main/README.md
